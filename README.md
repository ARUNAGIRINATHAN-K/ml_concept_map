# 🧠 ML Concept Map – Interactive Visualization with Python

An interactive concept map of core **Machine Learning** topics built using **NetworkX** and **PyVis** in Python. This project helps visualize relationships between fundamental ML concepts such as Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, key algorithms (e.g., Regression, SVM, Neural Networks), and optimization techniques like Gradient Descent.

## 🔍 Features

- 🔗 Graph structure linking ML concepts
- 🌈 Color-coded nodes based on category (e.g., algorithms, optimization, learning types)
- 🖱️ Interactive drag, zoom, and explore interface
- 🌐 Exported as an HTML file that opens in any browser

## 📌 Technologies Used

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)
- [PyVis](https://pyvis.readthedocs.io/)
